# candidatron
Candidate generator

The Candidatron is a candidate generator, merging two candidates' names, party name, slogan and photo.

For now the photo merging has not been implemented. That would be the top 1 feature, allowing to easily create new sets of data.
The following project (https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) would make it possible, but I failed to make it work on the candidatron.

Feel free to contribute !
Cheers,
